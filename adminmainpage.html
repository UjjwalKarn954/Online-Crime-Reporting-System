 Till now, crime reporting system in India is online FIR system or manual reporting in Police stations.
 If any incident happens in any area, then crime reporting can be done via telephone or in person. 
 No actual scene reporting is possible till date. People should be able to seek help in case of emergency on time.
 A large number of incidents happen in front of people but people are unable to report those incidents to police immediately.
 India must focus on inculcating an automated system for immediate crime reporting to police surpassing all controllable and uncontrollable factors responsible for unreported crimes.
 Hence, this paper proposes a smart system that can be implemented for immediate crime reporting to enhance crime reporting which is highly required in today's scenario. </p></br>
